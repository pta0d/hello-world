# This is my new *Markdown* sandbox
Initial doc to copy to.

---------

I will edit this file to practice md.
# First header
## Second header
### And a third one
Here is some **bold** text and *italicized* text, and now **both *bold and italic*** text.
The following
> line of text

is a blockquote. And some C code:
`printf("Hi markdown!");`

---------

```c
void fun() {
  printf("Hi C again!");
}
```
